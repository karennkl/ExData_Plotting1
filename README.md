# Introduction

There are 8 files for the Course Project 1: 4 png pictures (480 x 480 pixels) and 4 scripts to generate each.

To run this script you need to to the following:

  1. Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to a working directory;
  2. Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
  3. Extract the data into the same working directory;
  4. Run the scripts

## Dataset Description

The dataset showcases measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a 
one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities 
and some sub-metering values are available.

The following are descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset 

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>
